Steriani spent 17 years at the University of Illinois and Pennsylvania State University before continuing her research at the University of Ostrava and is now considered one of the leading Czech specialists in this field. So when she made time for Radio Prague International I began by asking her to enumerate the benefits we get from regular exercise.  ", "“Exercise or physical activity has numerous beneficial effects –it increases our heart rate, breathing rate and as a result of that we produce certain chemicals, neuro-transmitters like serotonin and dopamine that effect our mood. There is a whole array of physiological benefits which are responsible for the fact that we feel well after exercising. We have an elated mood due to the fact that our body has started producing some chemicals in our brain. Among the many psychological benefits that exercising gives us is a new level of confidence, or perceived competence about what we can do; we have a more positive attitude about ourselves and how we view our bodies, which in turn can increase our sense of self-worth and self-esteem and that can also contribute to feeling better and having a better quality of life.”", "“I would say so. Studies show that there was a decrease in physical activity during the lockdown and, hand in hand with that, there was a decrease in mental health. Of course there are other factors that contribute to mental wellbeing but reduced physical activity is definitely one of them.”", "“I wouldn’t say we are the most or least active nation. I think we are on par with most countries in Europe. We do a lot of sports, but we are not necessarily sufficiently active. Those two things can be true at the same time.”", "“Yes, but children nowadays are actually engaged in sports as well – to a higher level than ever before. But what is declining is spontaneous physical activity, when the child is not at volleyball or tennis, the remaining hours of the day have become more inactive. That is a new phenomenon”.", "“We benefit from physical activity throughout life, but certain benefits are more important during the different phases of life. So, when we are talking about children and youth we are talking about benefits such as building self-confidence, learning fair-play, learning how to communicate with peers and learning to be socially engaged. As for older adults they are typically worried about two things – loss of independence, that they might start being dependent on someone else and loss of cognitive function – in other words dementia.  Both of those – physical function and cognition – can be enhanced by physical activity. Physical activity is a great preventative measure in terms of slowing the decline that comes with age.”", "“It is one of the ways to address it. What also contributes to the problem is obesity – so many people are overweight these days. So physical activity would help with that as well, although there are various factors involved in obesity. We do know that people who are life-long exercisers are in better health, feel better and age well –or age better. Physical activity throughout life is the key to more healthy aging.”", "“Walking is a great activity. You do not need anything to do it and it fulfills what we expect from physical activity. Of course, the more active you are the higher the benefits. Studies show that you can get double the benefits by increasing intensity, but that is not necessary to get psychological benefits from physical activity. So walking is great. Just not sitting is very important. The amount of time we spend sitting contributes negatively to our mental health –independently of how physically active we are.”", "“For people who are 18 to 65 and even older people without significant limitations –we recommend 150 minutes of physical activity per week at moderate or vigorous intensity. That’s an intensity that allows you to talk in short sentences. Being a little bit out of breath, with an increased heart rate but still being able to hold a conversation in short sentences.”", "“No, yoga wouldn’t meet that requirement. It is not a typical aerobic-type activity.  Of course it depends on what kind of yoga you do. There are types that will give you a good workout. For instance in power yoga you can increase your heart rate to a level that may reach “moderate intensity”. Typically, we wouldn’t consider it the best example of “moderate intensity” exercise. But yoga has other benefits – it helps with balance, flexibility and it can promote the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activity – so it helps to promote wellbeing, helps with stress-relief and so on.”", "“It is definitely easier to exercise with someone. There are individual needs of course, so if you have a preference to be alone, then that’s what you should do. But, generally, with someone else people are better able to sustain the activity and overcome hurdles. So I would definitely not recommend people who are starting to exercise alone.”", "“You will feel the benefits right after the first walk. If we are talking about a mood-enhancing effect, you will benefit from it for 2-4 hours after that first bout of exercise. Studies show that the mood enhancing effect can last up to 24 or even 48 hours, but that is rare. So there are reasons why we recommend daily activity –or every other day, at the worst - because after that you would be losing most of the benefit of the activity on your mood.”", "“You need to give it 8 to 12 weeks to really see the effects. People need to give it a while. Of course, I understand that they need to see improvement to be motivated to continue. In many ways today’s technologies are very useful in this respect because you can track your progress. So you look back and say –three weeks ago I was only able to do this much and now I can do this much – that is very important feedback.”", "“Yes, but that is true of a very small number of people. Those are special, extreme cases and I would say most people don’t have to worry about that. We have the opposite problem. Over-exercising is only a problem when it takes over someone’s life to the point that they are neglecting other important areas of life. But as I said, that’s very rare.”", "“I would say that most of the studies that we undertook with older adults showed impressive results. We typically recruit people who are insufficiently active – they are often old and frail when we start working with them and we see, even after three or four weeks, that they are increasing their capacity, they are feeling more confident. Just the fact that they believe they can do something is a huge psychological shift for them. In old age that may be even more important than what we can measure on some machine – the fact that they are confident they can walk to the store and back by themselves or put away their groceries on their own – and we can achieve that with physical activity.”", "“We are starting to work on this. I would say that in the Czech Republic these things are a little bit slower than in the United States, but yes, we do have a strategy and a goal to engage children in more physical activity. Part of it involves working with schools and making sure that the curricula requires that a certain portion of the school day is spent on physical activity. In the Czech Republic right now we only require two hours of physical activity per week which is really not very much and we hope that in the future we can change that.”", "“I would say that walking is one of the most common activities. And, with the Covid pandemic, what happened was that people actually started going outdoors more, which is very positive. Walking outdoors, hiking or running have certainly increased in popularity in the last couple of years.”", "“Yes, if you have it. I’m from Ostrava which is not the best place for it.

And regarding the salivary glands, at the beginning of the treatment some side effects such as xerostomia were seen, meaning the patients had dry mouth, because the pharmaceutical accumulated in the salivary glands. However, this was solved during the clinical trials by applying the proper dosage. Xerostomia is not such an issue anymore and it’s also reversible.

One is that it is the basis for a lot of later perfumes. Its main ingredient is myrrh, which is pretty much the main ingredient in any Egyptian perfume from the period that we are looking at.", "“The second reason is that it is the simplest. It is supposed to be the only simple uncompounded perfume. This is what our sources tell us.

They say that the method could also help shed light on Ancient Rome’s economy. I spoke to one of the leaders of the project, Daniel Bursák from the Archeological Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences, and began by asking him why the team chose to focus on brass. ", "“That’s the main reason why we chose to study objects found on the territory of the modern Czech Republic. We have a lot of brass items from this period located in the collections of museums and institutes. This is because of the historical situation at that time.", "“During the period that we are speaking about there was a massive influx of Roman items into the lands that make up modern Bohemia and Moravia. Back then, this area housed the Germanic Empire of Marobudos and the Romans and Germanic tribes had quite intensive diplomatic contacts at that time. We therefore had a good opportunity to analyse a lot of items that are quite rare even among those found in what were Roman provinces.”", " ", " ", "“Because there were no other studies into the prominence of items made of Roman brass, we chose a relatively new methodology that is based on the analysis of the chemical composition and isotopic ratios.", " ", "“It is one of the first times ever that this methodology has been applied to Roman brass items and is definitely on the largest scale yet conducted.”", " ", " ", "“That was probably the most thrilling find we made. We now know that it most likely came from the Massif Central in central-southern France [or what was then Gaul]. It was probably was mined around the city of Lyon and the south-eastern part of the Massif Central.", " ", "“That area had recently been conquered by Ceasar, in the first century BC period that we are talking about. As we can now see, the Romans were able to collect quite a lot of potential resources from there for their economy.", " ", "“They chose brass as one of the metals for striking their coins and this territory was therefore a very useful conquest, not just as an agricultural area, but also for the mining of metals.”", " ", " ", "“Yes.”", " ", " ", "“What we already know from our studies is that there were definitely more metal sources for Roman brass. Literary sources, such as Pliny the Elder, mention sources in Northern Italy, in Germany and there were also some mentions of Gallic deposits used for making brass.", " ", "“However, no one knew where those sources were located and we are now much closer to finding those mines that were mentioned by Pliny the Elder.”", " ", " ", "“There are many reasons for that. First of all, brass looked more like gold than bronze did. It is more golden in colour. Literary sources also mention that even the Romans mistook brass for gold. Especially for barbarians here in the north, it must have been a very prized metal.", " ", "“It should also be stated that making brass was much more complicated than smelting copper. This is because you need to use a process called cementation. I do not want to get too much into the technical details, but you need a very specific temperature ranging between roughly 900 and 1,000 degrees Celsius and very well established protocol of how to make it. Let us not forget that this had to be carried out without any available instruments for temperature measurement.", "“Brass was therefore valued not only for its golden colour, but also for the technical complexity involved in smelting it. The Romans were able at that time to produce brass in quite substantial quantities, so much so in fact that they used it for striking quite common coins, such as sesterces. For the barbarians living north or east of the Roman borders, brass was an astonishingly attractive item.”", " ", " ", "“It certainly must have been so. Especially in the beginning when brass started coming in and before they acquired it in substantial enough quantities. This must have been a great diplomatic tool for the Romans when dealing with these early Germanic kingdoms, such as the Empire of Marobudos.", "“The Romans, especially after they were defeated at the Battle of the Teutoborg forrest [in 9 AD during the reign of Augustus], were quite vulnerable to Germanic attacks and we see a great influx of Roman objects to these territories, including this shiny metal, after that battle. We cannot say for certain that brass was used in the form of diplomatic gifts. However, considering all of the circumstances, it would have been very useful for the Romans to use it in this way.”", " ", " ", "“Yes. These were mainly brooches and other pieces of jewellery, such as bell fittings, pins and needles.", " ", "“It should also be noted that these brass objects are quite massive. If you compare them with brooches made a hundred years before this period, they were just half their weight, so not only are they using a new method but also making much bigger decorative items.", " ", "“We sampled the items that we analysed from 14 sites, mostly from Central and Eastern Bohemia, and we found brass in almost every one of these objects.

Therefore, the border was more fluid and the newly conquered areas needed to be consolidated.

Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius was fighting with Germanic tribes in and around this region, defending what had by then already been firmly established Roman territories of Noricum, Panonia and Illyria.

Mewery is, in its own words, “the first European foodtech startup developing cultivated pork on a proprietary microalgae base”.

These alternative proteins are solving this challenge we have ahead of us, not only climate change, but also antibiotic resistance and a growing population.", "One of the main alternatives which you might already know, either from supermarkets here in the Czech Republic or worldwide, are plant-based alternatives, which is something that pretends to be meat, it’s very close to meat, but still in terms of texture and taste it’s not really there, and it’s mainly for vegans and vegetarians.", "But the new emerging part of alternative protein is cultivated meat, which is basically meat that you make from cells – so you take a tissue or a stem cell from the animal, and then you cultivate it in an environment which mimics the animal itself. So basically you are bringing the cells of the animal into an environment where cells can grow and divide, so they can also become the desired type of cell which grows into meat.", "Meat is basically muscle cells, fat cells, and – to put it in lay terms – an in-between mass in between the cells themselves.”", "“Definitely – of course, this is a relevant point, because it is a very new technology which has never been used for food before.

And if you go even deeper, you realise that we hardly know what the sausages and hot dogs we eat consist of.", "So this approach of cultivating cells in the lab, it’s a very different way of tracing what the meat is really made of. It’s a very sterile environment, the labs have to have a very high standard of safety and sterility where you can work with cells. So if you compare these two methods, you have a very traceable and very clear way of proving what you have in the medium, and you can also show what the end product consists of.", "So there will be a lot of education needed on the customer acceptance side – this is one of the challenges and it comes with all new emerging technologies. So there will be a lot of education needed on that level. What people need to understand is that you can have a new method of getting meat without having to kill any animals. This would be my first argument to consider.", "And the second is that climate change is getting more and more serious and people are starting to realise that this is also a way of contributing, without changing your diet by becoming vegetarian, vegan or flexitarian - there is an alternative which is cleaner, healthier, and more nutrient-rich.", "One really needs to understand that the process of cultivating meat in the lab is just another process by which cells grow.

Hundreds of millions of people around the world wear contacts every day, but they may not be aware that the invention of the modern soft contact lens came from this country.", "The idea to correct or enhance human vision with a device inserted into the eye is very old. It can be traced back to Leonardo da Vinci’s writings in the early 16th century. The end of the 19th century saw the very first glass lenses and in the 1940s, the first corneal lenses were developed. However, these early rigid lenses were quite expensive and fragile and certain types did not allow the eyes to breathe. But in the 1950s, Czech chemists came up with just the right kind of material.", "Otto Wichterle was born in 1913 into a family of entrepreneurs but his career of choice was science. He graduated from the University of Chemistry and Technology in Prague and went on to study medicine. After the Nazis closed Czech universities, he was offered the opportunity to establish a laboratory at the Baťa shoe company in Zlín. After 1945 he returned to Prague and helped reinstate chemistry lectures at the university.", "The story of the modern soft contact lens began one fine summer day in 1952, when Otto Wichterle travelled on a train to Prague. Jiří Michálek from the Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry was a one-time colleague of Professor Wichterle.", "The two men agreed on the need for a soft material that would be well tolerated by the human body, ideally some kind of plastic. As a matter of fact, this was precisely the area of Otto Wichterle’s research. He envisaged materials that could bind water and proceeded to actually develop them.", "Many did not believe that the soft hydrophilic polymethacrylate gel he developed could have good optical properties but in 1959 tests proved that soft hydrophilic lenses were able to correct vision and were well tolerated by patients.", "In 1958, Otto Wichterle was fired from the University of Chemistry and Technology for his unwillingness to apply political criteria in the assessment of students. A few months later, he was employed by the more liberal Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and later became the founder and first director of its Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry.", "In 1960, the article “Hydrophilic gels for biological use” was published in the British scientific journal Nature, authored by Otto Wichterle and Drahoslav Lím. It was considered a breakthrough in the history of the soft lens. It is hard to believe that in 1961, the health ministry cancelled the research. But Professor Wichterle continued in his experiments at home.", "Once he had the revolutionary material, the next step was the production of the lens itself. One day he was stirring his coffee and the centrifugal force inspired him to try and produce the lenses in some kind of a spinning bowl. And it worked. Professor Wichterle constructed the legendary čočkostroj – or “lens-machine” used for spin-casting lenses in his own bedroom. He built it using his children's toy construction set and a bicycle dynamo. With the help of his wife Linda, a stomatologist, he produced the first hydrogel contact lenses on this home-made apparatus during Christmas of 1961. Immediately after Christmas Otto Wichterle submitted a patent application.", "In 1964 he presented his invention to a foreign licencing partner. He demonstrated the resilience of the material by wearing the lens, taking it out of his eye, stepping on it, then cleaning it between his fingers and in his mouth and putting it back into his eye. In 1965, the first contract was signed between the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and the US National Patent Development Corporation which sublicensed the rights to a commercial producer. In 1972 the company finally got the green light from the US Food and Drug Administration and was able to launch the first hydrophilic soft contact lenses on the market.", "Since then, further research has been taken over by commercial subjects and has primarily focused on the user, as Jiří Michálek says. ", "The 1970s were marked by legal disputes in the United States over Professor Wichterle’s patents and for fear of having to pay large legal fees, Czechoslovakia gave up its rights for a fraction of their value and thus lost a large part of its revenue. Some say it is a pity that the country sold the rights instead of producing the lenses itself. Others say a small country behind the Iron Curtain with a state-controlled economy would not have been able to produce and efficiently distribute the product in sufficient quantity, not mentioning marketing.", "Even though the soft contact lens is now primarily a commercial concern, the materials developed by Professor Otto Wichterle are still studied by scientists. Jiří Michálek from the Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry:", "Professor Wichterle is described by his former colleagues as a man of high intelligence, versatility, passion for problem solving, profound knowledge of many subjects, manual dexterity, fluency in a number of foreign languages and also personal and moral integrity and courage.", "In the spring of 1968, he was one of the men behind a political manifesto and one of its first signatories. The document was later labelled as counterrevolutionary by the Communist Party and its signatories were persecuted. Professor Wichterle lost his job as the director of the Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry. For a brief period, he was also a deputy of the national and federal parliament but he resigned in late 1969.", "After the Velvet Revolution he returned to public life and became the chairman of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. Otto Wichterle died in 1998 aged 84. There is a fascinating story behind many everyday objects. Next time you put in your contacts in the morning, you may remember the story of the ingenious and brave Czech academic Otto Wichterle and his “lens-machine” fashioned from a children’s toy construction set."], "author": "Pavla Horáková", "publish_date": "03/04/2021"},

I spoke to him about his life’s work, shortly after NASA named his breath-taking picture of the comet NEOWISE – now closer than ever to the Earth – as “Astronomy Picture of the Day”.", "I began by asking Petr Horálek, an astronomer by education, how he first got into star-gazing.", "“It all started when I was very young, in 1997, when I was at my grandparents at their cottage. My grandmother wanted to show me the Big Dipper in the sky. At that time, it wasn’t all that interesting to me at first. But then she showed me its shape on paper, and I got interested and went outside again. More than the shape, it was interesting to me that the Big Dipper was in a different place in the sky because of the rotation of the Earth. And that was the impulse that got me so fascinated by astronomy.”", "“I wanted to learn every about astronomy, and when I got to university, the most interesting thing to me was the total solar eclipses because they are very interesting not only from the scientific perspective but also for everyone who sees one. They always get people so excited and fascinated – you want to see it again and again.", "“When I graduated from Masaryk University, I started to work on observing fireballs [bolides] in the sky. I was part of a big team monitoring fire balls. But in my personal interests, I started to focus more on photography. So, professionally I was focused more on interplanetary matter, but I wanted to know more about solar eclipses and the solar atmosphere, which made me even more fascinated with the eclipses.”", "“In 2014, I stopped doing any professional astronomy and went to the New Zealand orchards to just enjoy the dark skies of the southern hemisphere. I was really fascinated and motivated when I saw the whole of the constellation Scorpius, which is probably the most beautiful constellation in the sky also because it is close to the centre of the Milky Way.", "“Unlike in our part of Europe, there you can see the centre of the Milky Way just above the horizon. The centre reaches the zenith and you have it just above your head. And it’s so bright, especially in such a dark sky, that if you have a good camera, even an average camera, you can capture your own shadow, cast by the Milky Way – which is completely crazy.”", "“I was always somehow more interested in the popularization of astronomy that the professional astrophysics and astronomy. So, I always tried to be part of some group which focuses on showing the night skies to people.", "“When I became a Photo Ambassador for the European Southern Observatory, which brought be to Chile and the Atacama Desert, I was able to make some good photographs and use them to show people what is so amazing in the sky, and why we should fight against light pollution. A part of what I do in popularizing astronomy is always about the fight against light pollution.”", "“Each one is very unique, and of course every experience completely different, so I can’t share them all. But I can share one or two, maybe.", "“One was the second solar eclipse I saw, which was in Turkey and one of the longest I have seen. It was unforgettable because we were in a small village by the Mediterranean, and we could clearly see such a beautiful corona, which was huge – it can seem to be five times larger than the Sun in the sky. Also because of the emotions, of course. Thousands and thousands of people were on the beach, and the emotions around were very clear. And you are a part of that. So, that was more about the emotions than what was in the sky.", "“Another beautiful moment came about a year ago, when I was an ESO Photo Ambassador and saw a total solar eclipse at the La Silla observatory. It was very unique because the next one will occur in 2231. And because you are in the Atacama Desert and at a very high altitude, about 2,400 metres above sea level, you could see such a beautiful, clear solar eclipse with such colours in the sky – because the eclipse was very low over the horizon. You could see a U shape of a lunar shadow in the sky moving your direction, the colours of the illumination of the sky against the backdrop of the desert. It was one of the most magical experiences.”", "“Well, astronomers cannot name an asteroid after themselves. The only object that you can name after yourself is a comet.

Actually, even the editors of the Astronomy Picture of the Day were amazed by this, so they published it.", "“As for the comet itself, it’s really an amazing one. It’s probably the most beautiful in 22 years, at least in the northern hemisphere. At this moment, it’s getting its closest to the Earth, which occurs on July 23, but it’s getting dimmer because it’s farther from the Sun, the sunlight is not so close. But photographically, it is huge, and it’s ion tail is long as the width of the Big Dipper in the sky.", "“For a photographer, it’s an amazing object, but also for the public, who can just travel away from the cities and see it very easily with the naked eye or a small telescope until the end of this week, and then the Moon starts to shine too bright. So now are the best conditions.”", "“Well, I have a list of the most unique and most amazing phenomena, and the comet was actually one of them, and finally I have it. The last thing I haven’t seen in my life – and it’s actually very rare, and I don’t know if I will have a chance at all – is a galactic supernova [a powerful stellar explosion, which can create a black hole].", "“It’s something that occurs, statistically, once every 200 years. The last one occurred at the beginning of the 17th century [Kepler's Supernova in 1604]. So, statistically, it could occur any day. It could make a star shine even brighter than a full moon for weeks. So, hopefully all the world, not just me, soon will have a chance to see this very rare event in the sky.”", "Petr Horálek’s photograph, entitled The Long Tails of Comet NEOWISE, which captures the sky above Suchý vrch in the Orlické region, was taken on the night of July 13-14, when the Sun was almost directly below the comet, deep it the horizon. Thanks to this, the bluish, so-called ion tail of the comet appears to point almost vertically upwards, and it is possible to recognize some nodes, caused by the reaction of ionised gas to the solar wind.

They collected data for their study from forests on three continents, evaluating them for 14 years. The results were recently published in the scientific magazine Ecology Letters.", "I discussed the study with Vojtěch Novotný, head of the Ecology Department at the Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences:", "“We have been trying to evaluate the species diversity of tropical rainforests in the first place. Everybody knows that these are highly diverse places but surprisingly we don’t actually have a very specific idea how many insects for instance are living in one hectare of tropical forest. That is still unknown.", "“Our research focused on a number of different groups of insects, not only counting species but also on what they are doing in this forest ecologically: What are their requirements for survival? What is their impact on plants? What is their impact as food for birds and other vertebrate species? So the first big topic of our study was the complex ecology of a rainforest.", "“The second one was to explain why there are so many species in the tropics compared to the forests in the temperate zone. That’s why we did a lot of comparative studies of tropical and temperate zone forests across different continents.”", "“First, when we want to do a tropical versus temperate zone comparison, we have to take into account the whole history of evolution of ecosystems on Earth.", "“Every continent is a sort of biological laboratory on its own. That’s why we wanted to have comparisons in Asia, so we chose Japan in the temperate zone, and then compared it with the tropics, which is New Guinea, in our case.", "“Likewise, we have the Czech Republic as an example of a European ecosystem and then we went to Cameroun for the tropical counterpart.  Finally it was the United States and Panama in the Americas.”", "\n    ", "\n    ", "\n    ", "“The main problem with doing research on insects living on trees is that all interesting action takes place up in the canopy.

It is a construction built in the middle of a forest and instead of lifting material for building construction, they lift researchers up in a little gondola.", "“So you can guide that crane and be lifted up to the canopy and there is about one hectare of forest within reach for research. Unfortunately there are very few cranes like that. We were able to use one in Japan and Panama.", "“And finally, and that was the most adventurous part of our study, we built one such crane in Papua New Guinea. So now we have a crane of our own and can use it full time.”", "“It took us over six years. We are still continuing some collections but the main set of data is ready.", "“At every location we also have to think about the seasonal change. Especially in the temperature zone, when leaves are flushing in spring, that’s our busiest season, when all the insects are there to eat the young leaves.", "“When you come later in the season, towards the summer and autumn, you can find completely different insect species there. In the tropics you have a rainy season and a dry season, again with a change of insects.", "“With the teams ranging from ten to twenty people at each location we were able to obtain enough samples for the study.", "“We had a working hypothesis that insects in the tropics are especially rich. That’s why biologists are so interested in the tropics.", "“But when we actually look closely at the relationships between insects and their vegetation, we found out that for many insect groups, we can actually predict the number of insect species from the diversity of vegetation.", "“So the reason why tropics look so diverse to us is simply that we have a very impoverished vegetation in our forests in Europe, as well as in the temperate zone Asia and America.", "“It’s because of the relatively recent glacial periods which really decimated the number of tree and plant species which are growing in these temperate zones.", "“So we are still living the consequences of this biological disaster of the Ice Ages and that’s why we have, in comparison to the tropics, so few insect species here.”", "One of the things that you have discovered is that that there are far more caterpillars in the temperate forests than in the tropical rain forests. Why is that? What has the greatest influence on the number of insects in forests?", "“Yes, that was another interesting finding. So far I have been talking about the number of species, about the variety of insects. But when we look at the number of individuals, then surprisingly we find that in certain periods of the year, in the spring, forests here are actually supporting a higher number of insects, higher number of caterpillars, than the tropics.", "“So the lush vegetation of the tropics is mostly inedible, because it’s heavily protected both chemically and mechanically, for instance by spikes or hairs. It is made very difficult for insects to feed on the vegetation.", "“While here in the temperate zone, except for coniferous, all the broad-leave trees have to shed leaves in the winter. They have no other choice than to flush new leaves in the spring, and these are very attractive for insects.", "“So suddenly there is much more food at a given time in spring in the temperate zone forest than at any time in the tropical forest.”", "“I would say there are two answers to this question. One is, because people are curious about their surroundings. We want to know things, even if they are of no immediate use to us.", "“Of course we have always been wondering about the tropical forests. They are very attractive psychologically to us because they are so exotic. So I would say that’s one reason.", "“And then there is also a practical reason. There is a very close connection between the diversity of vegetation and the impact insects can have on this vegetation.", "“For instance, here we have bark beetles, which are destroying large areas of the forests in central Europe. That happens extremely rarely in tropical forests. That’s because they would have a very hard time to achieve such an impact in a diverse forest.", "\n    ", "\n    ", "\n    ", "“This is a clear direction that if our forestry goes for mixed species forests, they will be much better protected against an outbreak of insects such as we are experiencing right now. So that’s one example of how this research can guide our thinking here in Europe.”", "“I think there is no doubt that there is a serious decline in insects in Europe, which has been converted into a human-managed ecosystem.  But it is a hot topic of ecological research right now whether the tropics are facing a similar decline or not.", "“I would say this really depends on the region considered. When you go to Malaysia or Indonesia with huge oil palm fields, than yes. These definitely reduce the numbers of insects and are generally a disaster for the diversity of the landscape.", "“We don’t have anything like this in Papua New Guinea. That’s still a much healthier landscape with 70 percent of the forest. So personally we have not seen any decline of insects there over the 25 years we have been carrying our research there.", "“Unfortunately we have not been studying these questions. But from what we have seen, the lesson is that as long as we keep a healthy landscape, insects are very adaptable and can survive well in these kinds of diverse landscapes. If we convert everything to huge agricultural fields, it will lead to a disaster.”", "“Yes. As it is in science, it is not a definitive and complete answer.

The areas without insects ended up being much less diverse botanically than the areas where we let insects in.", "“So it looks like insects function as a sort of diversity police. That’s because without insects, plants which are very successful and can grow fast will dominate the vegetation and outcompete the other plants.", "“With insects, if some plants are getting more common, they will feed especially on these common plants and they will limit their growth and unintentionally give a chance to rare plants to survive."], "author": "Ruth Fraňková", "publish_date": "10/29/2020"},

All the African glaciers are going to be gone within the next decade, maybe even earlier.", "“We believe that they are quite different from all the other glaciers, the Alpine and the polar ones. They have been isolated from the glacier community for a long time. The second reason is that the temperatures there are essentially the same all year round and in the night it freezes.", "“So what is happening is that there is liquid water and the glaciers are melting all year round essentially non-stop.

An important fact is that the higher these objects’ velocity, the more exponential is the damage they can do.”", "“We are hit by asteroids every day. When we are talking about so-called city killers, the destructive ones can fall every year.

We are currently monitoring asteroids bigger than 240m. That is the task of NASA. When it comes to deciding on whether we will act in response to the threat the United Nations threshold is 50 meters.", "“The major group of asteroids in our solar system is called the Asteroid Belt. It lies between Mars and Jupiter. However, when it comes to the hidden asteroids that can suddenly impact Earth, these tend to come from the Sun.", "“They are of course also orbiting the sun, but you often don’t have data about their trajectories and simply find them before they hit the earth. That is what happened in Chelyabinsk, Russia a few years ago.", "“You don’t see them coming, because they are approaching from the Sun and you don’t see anything coming from the Sun, because detection works on detecting the reflection of sun heat. You do not see them in the visible light spectrum, you see them much better in the infrared spectrum.", "“That is why you need to be between the sun and the asteroid. It is also why you have to know the overall situation in the solar system rather than simply being able to quickly detect asteroids approaching the earth.”", "“As my colleagues like to say: ‘An asteroid does not discriminate’.” If you have a country big enough to cover all the requirements necessary for space defence, it is not necessarily mean a correct approach, because you do not want to have one country in the world capable of defending the whole planet.", "“The point is that we are supposed to have a global planetary defence capability where several countries can contribute on different agendas and technologies.", "\n    ", "\n    ", "\n    ", "“When it comes to the knowledge capacities we have here in the Czech Republic, it is definitely astronomy.

The point is that if we can flyby asteroid (which is easier than to sit on its orbit) and fire a laser on it in such a huge velocities, than we can gather huge amount of data because that one space craft can flyby many asteroids during one mission.", "“That is very important not just for advances in asteroid mining, but also in having statistical data about asteroids. In other words, where they are coming from and what they are made out of.”", "“I think that a small country such as the Czech Republic can do several things. For example, we should be able to develop not necessarily the whole instrument, but key technologies which make up parts of it and define the national niche when it comes to particular technologies.", "“We decided to choose lasers, because of the laser centre we have in Dolní Břežany near Prague.", "“There are also other things we can do as a small country.

If you are pointing this satellite at a target which is several hundred thousand or even millions of kilometres away, then the satellites which are on an orbit closer to earth will simply fly through the laser light but will not be affected.", "“This is because you focused the laser towards a distance much farther away from earth.

With his new book Einstein in Bohemia, Princeton University history professor Michael D Gordin makes a compelling case that not only did Einstein’s time in Prague shape the science, literature, and even politics of the city for decades to come, the same is true in reverse: the acquaintances Einstein made in Bohemia and ideas he was first exposed to there continued to occupy him.", "Before receiving a review copy of his book, I had heard a lecture by Prof. Gordin on Einstein in which he said he started looking into his time in Prague at first thinking he would write a “micro-history” about that year and a half, and then “an intellectual urban history” of the Bohemian capital, before gravitating towards a hybrid of the two. I began by asking Prof. Gordin what drew him to the subject and how and why his concept for his book Einstein in Bohemia evolved.", "“I began my career as a historian of science in Russia and the Soviet Union, and that interest quickly expanded to other Slavic areas. I was interested in a whole bunch of topics, but like all historians of the physical sciences, I was interested in Einstein.", "“While reading several biographies of him, I noticed only very brief mentions of his time in Prague; that he had received a position in Prague, arrived in 1911 and left in 1912.", "“And I thought wouldn’t it be interesting to focus just on that year and a half and see what one could find. I started studying Czech for a number of reasons and thought that would help with the project, which it did.”", "“Einstein is a special case not in the history of science but in much of 20th century history, in that he is incredibly well documented. We have a very large number of his letters, his notebooks, reminiscences about him, government documents, etc. So, I thought I would investigate in very close detail what he did almost week by week, from when he arrived in early April 1911 to when he left in August of 1912. What he taught, who he met, etc.", "“The second problem is that it wasn’t terribly interesting. Most of what he did was go to work, think about physics and go home. He had very limited engagements with the culture of the city – but I became interested in those engagements and the culture of the city. The more I dug into those, the richer it seemed to be to talk not just about Einstein but to talk about the world he had been in, and follow also the lives of his major interlocutors where he was.", "“So, I tracked them through this period – and this is where it being Prague is especially helpful in that the city in the pre-World War I period, from say 1900 to 1914 is also extremely well documented because of lot of interest especially in the life of Franz Kafka, who had many similar connections to Einstein.", "“I was able to trace a lot of that environment, and that’s where the book came from – trying to look in-depth at a particular person in a particular place, and then following the strands of his influence and the influences upon him over time.”", "“The Swiss Einstein was the precocious genius, who overturned classical physics with special relativity and quantum theory. The Berlin Einstein was an international celebrity, adored by millions as the Newton of the modern age while garnering enemies because of his deeply felt views about pacifism, nationalism and Zionism. The Princeton Einstein was the sage of the 20th century, warning of the dangers of the future under the shadow of the atomic bomb. Tell me where your Einstein is, and I will tell you who he is.”", "So, what kind of the Einstein do we see if we follow him around Prague, and then trace connections that began there and radiated throughout his life? The result, Prof. Gordin writes, is a new Einstein, “whose biography is inflected in different ways as we find him deeply enmeshed not just with scientists but with writers, philosophers, politicians, and—through the lodestar of Prague—a participant in some of the major dramas of the 20th century.”", "Einstein also found himself constrained to German-speaking intellectual circles. Some, such as the philosopher Hugo Bergmann, and Franz Kafka’s publisher Max Brod, who likely introduced the two great intellectuals, and certainly Einstein to Zionism – a movement the famously anti-nationalist pacifist first rejected but would return to engage with through his Prague acquaintances.", "“When Einstein was in Zurich, which is where he lived before moving to Prague, he thought of himself as ‘without religion’ – konfessionslos – which you could absolutely register as, and it was important to register as a member of a faith or having no faith.", "“But you couldn’t take an oath for the civil service of loyalty to the Emperor without stating an actual religion because the Emperor didn’t think you could swear an oath without that. So, a Prague bureaucrat did change it to mosaic, to Jewish. Einstein agreed to that. He thought it was a relatively silly requirement.", "“Yet, when he had the choice – and when he moved to Berlin in 1914 and it was important again as an issue – he consistently tried to be ‘without religion’ as long as absolutely possible to do so. This resistance to categories imposed on him by states is a very prominent feature of Einstein’s life and attitude.", "“However, culturally, he always identified to some degree as a member of the Jewish people – and that becomes much stronger from 1918 until his death, even though he doesn’t believe he has any association with the religion.", "“And so for Einstein as a person, you can see the complexity of what it means to define yourself one way or another. With nationality, something similar happens, where he adopts or rejects citizenships more for convenience rather than out of patriotic loyalty, and this occasionally causes rather large problems in his life.”", "Professor Gordin depicts the intellectual, social, and political milieu of Prague before the World War I. He also demonstrates, through meticulous research, the long-term impact that Einstein’s short-term stay in Bohemia had on his scientific research, thoughts about nationalism, and his identity as a secular Jew, initially cool to the Zionist movement he was introduced to in Prague.", "“One of the major themes of the book is this problem of how to identify Einstein. Our identity is also defined by the people around us and how they choose to classify us. Einstein is an especially good person to look at this, and Prague is an especially good place to examine it.", "“Einstein was very often categorised as a ‘German’ and as a ‘Jew’, usually by different people, and those are both categories that he resisted throughout his life. He sometimes embraced them as an identification and sometimes rejected them. The place where that first came to a head for him – became a really problematic episode – was in Prague, where his Jewishness became important because the Hapsburg state thought it was important.", "“And his German-ness became important because he was in a city that had about 7 percent German-identified citizens and 93 percent Czech-identified citizens, with Jews on both sides of that divide. And so, in Prague, the status of someone as a ‘German’ – whether a Prague German, a Viennese German, or a German from outside of the Hapsburg Empire – became a very prominent category.", "“Einstein had never thought about himself in those ways before. So, by looking a Prague in the Hapsburg period, when it’s a particularly fraught question whether one is Jewish and German, Jewish and Czech, or some mixture of those, brought a lot of those issues to the surface.", "“And so, the first three chapters of the book follow Einstein himself in the city, and the last four chapters follow it after he left the city, and we see those themes from the Prague period percolate throughout his life, in many directions.”", "We pick up our discussion with Princeton University history professor Michael D Gordin on his new book, Einstein in Bohemia next week. In part two of this feature, we learn the exact nature of the work Einstein developed here, how he spent his leisure time in Prague, what he thought of the city – and of Czechs – and which intellectuals Einstein most influenced, was influenced by, and befriended."], "author": "Brian Kenety", "publish_date": "02/14/2020"},

The position at the German University in Prague was a significant step up for Einstein, then 32, in terms of status and salary. Yet he found life in Bohemia more alienating than enchanting: German-speakers like himself were an entrenched minority in the Hapsburg Slav capital, and Einstein’s young family had no established ties in Prague. This relative isolation, however, proved enormously fruitful, as we learn in this second part our discussion with Princeton University history professor Michael Gordin, author of the newly published book Einstein in Bohemia.", "At the same time, Einstein had yet to be offered such a prestigious, well-paid academic post, despite having published landmark papers in his “miracle year” of 1905 – on the photoelectric effect, among the most important early papers in quantum theory, discovered by German physicist Max Planck in 1900; on Brownian motion, the movement of molecules, helped calculate the size of atoms; and on relativity theory, which centres on electricity and magnetism, but involves notions that when travelling near the speed of light, time slows down.", "Prague seemed a golden opportunity for Einstein, who had famously struggled to get to an academic job despite having made these landmark discoveries, says Prof. Gordin:", "“He got a position at the University of Bern, teaching a little bit, and then eventually an assistant professor position in Zurich. And then Prague comes to him in 1910 wanting to hire him as a full professor – what was then called an ‘ordinary professor’ – and he eventually comes in 1911.", "“He was very young to get that position, and part of the reason he gets it is that Max Planck, the discoverer of quantum theory, strongly recommends Einstein as likely to be the next Copernicus – as someone who will have an enormous impact on the shape of physical science in the future.", "“And the people in Prague, for a variety of local reasons, are attracted by the philosophical implications of Einstein’s work, so they hire him. So, he gets there because of this strange pathway he had in his career before then, but also because of the strong philosophical flavour of his physics, which was very appealing to the faculty of the German University in Prague.”", "Plank and others viewed Albert Einstein as precisely the kind of young, visionary who could help boost the visibility of the German University in Prague, not least vis-à-vis its ascendant Czech counterpart.", "Einstein arrived in Bohemia on 3 April 1911, the day before his appointment began, and soon settled into his apartment in the rapidly expanding Smíchov neighbourhood, in a new art deco building on what is today Lesnická Street. Most every day, he would take a brisk walk to his office on the other side of the Vltava River, and ensconce himself in his office or the institution’s library – both of which he was quite pleased with.", "“Much of his life was him walking across Palacký Bridge, from where he lived in Smíchov to the Physics Faculty on Viničná Street, which was then called Weinbergstraße, or at least that’s what he always called it. And there’s a plaque inside the building there, right behind the botanical garden.", "“In terms of social life, he got outside of that professorial sphere through his passion for playing violin. In this age before widespread recorded music, the way to hear music was to play it yourself, so he would find a group of people that he could play violin concerti or string quartets music with.", "“In Prague, he did that through a student who was auditing his class called Hugo Bergmann – who later on became Shmuel Bergmann, a very important philosopher in Israel – and him to his mother-in-law’s house.", "“Her name was Berta Fanta, and she lived on Old Town Square, then called Altestatering, above the pharmacy of her husband, Max Fanta, which was called the White Unicorn. And Einstein spent a great deal of time there playing music, occasionally having discussions with them about various literary or philosophical topics.”", "“Generally, people say he played [the violin] well, but what they mean is he played better than they expected him to play. He seems to have been very technically competent. He enjoyed playing Mozart in particular, and Bach.", "“There’s a famous incident when he went back to Prague in 1921 he gave a lecture at the German-affiliated astronomy planetarium. He gave a talk, and then this philosopher from the German University, Oskar Kraus, one of the leading attackers of Relativity in this period, gives this very angry speech about why relativity is false and wrong.", "“Rather than answering him, Einstein took out his violin and played a little bit. Everybody thought that was charming. His violin brought a lot of affection to him in many contexts, and he was very attached to playing. I have no idea what he played at that particular moment. It would be lovely if we knew.”", "Einstein no doubt spent some time in the Café Louvre, says Prof. Gordin, but that particular circle had fallen apart by the time he arrived. It was Fanta’s salon that provided Einstein’s introduction to Zionism, and where he may have been first exposed to the ideas of Freud.", "“We know that Einstein spent a significant amount of time there – that’s where he met and became acquainted with Max Brod, where his friendship with [the philosopher and Zionist] Hugo Bergmann deepened. And the one time that we believe he and Kafka were in the same room, was at that salon, in the spring of 1911. So that was a large part of his social life.", "“He also liked spending a lot of time with the family of Moritz Winternitz, a Sanskritologist who taught at the German University. He would go visit their house and go on long walks in the hills behind the Lesser Town, in Petřín Hill – and in the forests outside of Prague.", "“His social life was very limited because he spent so much time on his work, and those were the main parts of the city he was engaged with. He was not very engaged with the Jewish quarter of the town [Josefov], and also had extremely limited contacts with the Czech-speaking intelligentsia of that time.”", "According to Kafka’s friend and posthumous publisher Max Brod, Einstein gave a talk about relativity theory at Fanta’s group on 24 May 1911, at which Kafka was present. Contrary to what a plaque erected outside Fanta’s home on Old Town Square says, there is no historical evidence that Einstein developed a friendship with Kafka, says Prof. Gordin – who has meticulously researched and cross-referenced the archives and unpublished letters of Einstein’s acquaintances.", "“In many of the texts about Einstein, there are casual references to Prague – or casual references to people that the author of the book didn’t know was a Prague German; they just assumed that they were German. If you know enough of the context, you can see those networks.", "“So, once I learned who his interlocutors were, through following these traces in the other literature, I was able to find where the repository of their documents were, and go through those. In the case of people like Max Brod, almost everything that he wrote has been published in some form – because there’s been so much scholarship around him because of Franz Kafka. So, you can sometimes find published, original letters.", "“But putting together most of the book required reading through unpublished materials or published letters to try and establish the networks of people that he knew – and where he knew them from.”", "“To some extent, yes. But it’s also the case that he has left a record that hasn’t been tapped into before in that his correspondence is being published right now, but they’ve only gotten as far as 1929. It’s very easy to get access to – it’s all available online, actually; these wonderfully transcribed letters to and from Einstein, up until 1929.", "“But he remained interested in Prague up until his death. So, you have to go through his old mail, which is preserved in these archival depositories – and that’s especially true for the other characters, whose material is sometimes not published at all.", "“One example of this is Einstein’s first physics assistant when he arrives in Prague, a Jewish mathematician named Emil Nohel originally from a Czech-speaking village [Mcely, in northern Bohemia] who ended up at the German University.", "“Emil Nohel died in the Holocaust. He was deported to Terezín and then to Auschwitz. But before he died he sent letters to his son in Palestine that contain a lot of information. They haven’t been published and are in the Yad Vashem archival repository in Jerusalem. They give some explanation of his past and connections to others in Prague and Vienna, where he moved after working with Einstein.”", "Moving to Prague was something of a caesura in Einstein’s personal life, but it was also importantly an intellectual rupture, in this case with quantum theory.", "During his tenure in Prague, which lasted three semesters, Einstein published almost a dozen papers, nearly all of which centred on how to expand his special theory of relativity to encompass accelerated frames of reference, something he knew would necessitate a new theory of gravity, say Prof. Gordin.", "“The version he developed in Prague ended up not working, so he developed a new version in Zurich and then in Berlin, publishing it in late 1915 – and that’s the theory that made him famous.”", "“That’s exactly right – it’s the fully advanced theory that has that quality. And the insight that brought him to that, he first had the idea in 1907 but works on it in Prague in 1911, is that in many conditions, there’s no way you can tell if you are in a gravitational field or whether you are accelerating.", "“So, it seems like gravity is the same as accelerated motion, and that symmetry, that equivalence, that he saw, made him develop a theory around the idea that space-time is intrinsically curved, and mass just follows straight paths in the complex geometry of space-time, which is warped by mass and energy. So, mass curves space, space moves mass.", "“That full theory is finished in Berlin in November 1915, but its origin points, the first full calculations he started to make, start in Prague really in the late summer and early fall of 1911 – that theory has problems, so he throws it away.”", "Otto Stern, Einstein’s research assistant during his third and final semester in Prague, said in an interview that the revolutionary physicist felt “completely isolated” in Prague, having found no-one he could talk to about matters that truly interested him – apart from a mathematician named Georg Pick, with whom he played in a quartet.", "In his correspondence from the time, Einstein also said he found Prague to be “beautiful” but “half-barbaric”, with a population generally hostile to the German-speaking minority though he did write that the Czechs “are much more harmless than one thinks”. He also grew far fonder of Prague after he left it, and followed the fate of independent Czechoslovakia with great interest, says Prof. Gordin again.", "“As for what he thought of Prague – here, as someone who enjoys being in Prague and likes the city – it’s kind of disappointing to read of Einstein’s views. He, in general, found his time in Prague complicated and difficult, at least that’s what he wrote to his friends back in Zurich.", "“And he writes to them with the kind of usual statements that someone raised in Germany or Switzerland would make of a Slavic-dominated region. He complains about things like bedbugs and the water, though he praises the cooking. He uses the word ‘barbarian’ a lot, which is offensive to see. But it’s not atypical for how German professors in Prague hired from outside looked at the city.", "“When he returns in 1921 – after Czechoslovakia is an independent country – he’s enormously happy with Prague. He admired Tomáš Masaryk enormously throughout Masaryk’s life, and he appreciated the enthusiasm and bubbling of activity one could see in Prague in the 1920s. And he followed the fate of Czechoslovakia very closely through the 1930s from abroad. So, his attitude towards the city was difficult when he was there, and as he moved farther away became much fonder.”", "“Yes, it does speak to that. And those relationships that he had to people in Prague tended to be Germans – people that would be called ‘Germans’. The closest one was with the person who took his job after he left, a very important philosopher and physicist of this period called Philipp Frank. He was in Prague from 1912 until 1938, and kept Einstein very informed about what was going on in Prague – about [Eduard] Beneš, about Masaryk – and their letters are quite interesting.", "“And Einstein also encouraged many people to either go through Prague, or in the 1930s when they flee Germany, to go to Czechoslovakia as a place where they could escape the fascist regime and the increasingly dictatorial regime in Austria.”", "“What I’d hoped would be the case when I started researching the book was that it would mostly be a chance to engage with Czech sources. … In the last chapter of the book I spend a great deal talking about the Czech-language reception of Einstein – so, how people in the 1920s and 1930s debated about Relativity, published textbooks about it.", "“Relativity theory was accepted in Prague, in the Czech language, quite quickly, and quite rapidly compared to other places. And there was a lot of high-quality work being done there, and even into the communist period there is an extensive Czech-language philosophical engagement with Einstein’s theories.", "“So, while much of what we’ve talked about, and much of the book is focused on a German-speaking and ethnic German milieu, as well as a Jewish-German milieu, there is a Czech component of the book which is quite important.

Moore's Law, which has driven the field, is gone. We have reached the limits and there is virtually no way to go beyond that.

This is one of the issues for classic spintronics: being too sensitive to magnetic field perturbations.

For example, one of the founding members of this team went on to work at Škoda to work on an electric drive for their upcoming car. When they showed him their state of the art battery pack, he said: ‘That is nice, but we have already had that on our formula race car two years ago.‘", "\"So, in many ways, the cars that we build are already ahead of the industry and we test out these technologies on the races under extreme conditions, which would be very costly for the automobile manufacturers to test themselves, because they would have to manufacture large quantities costing a lot of money which we do not have to worry about so much.\"", "\"I’ll give a little background first. Every race has 1000 points that are distributed among the teams. 700 of these points are distributed among the dynamic disciplines that involve the car’s performance and racing. The other 300 are distributed among so called, static disciplines. These are made up of the business plan, engineering, design, etc. The business plan itself makes up 75 points in the static disciplines. It may not be much, but it affects how the overall score as well as how the team works, because you have a management component as well there. If you manage the team correctly with few resources you can achieve great successes, whereas if you have loads of cash and but bad management, you will not do very well.\"", "\"No, they have to be students. They are part of the team and actually build the race cars with us.\"", "\"One thing is definitely to focus on the management side as well. It is not just a technical competition. In the end you have to deliver and to be able to do so you have to be well coordinated. The second tip I would give is not to be afraid of making mistakes. They let you move forward and learn, as well as teaching you how to make the best formula possible in the end.\"", "Building a formula race car is, of course, no cheap matter and sponsors need to be continually acquired. The teams and their vehicles therefore travel to various roadshows and exhibitions throughout the year to find new sponsors and bolster their public relations. Loyal sponsors of the team, get a visit to their headquarters, where they can apparently also try to drive some of the models.", "Next to the racetrack, another Czech Technical University team was showing off their wares.

After 10 years of development, the research centre has succeeded in obtaining a European patent, which guarantees the right to future production of this product for medical use.

Principally it consists of a network of molecules connected by weak bonds and a liquid which in hydrogels is water. Many human tissues are actually hydrogel –such as the liver, a portion of the skin…the human body itself is about 55 percent water and the water is weakly bound by various biomolecules.", " \"Researchers worldwide are trying to develop either synthetic or a combination of natural and synthetic polymer network which will resemble these tissues and use these networks, along with water to replace either missing tissues, cover wounds or burns and in some instances it is used to cultivate cells or tissues outside the body to be used for drug testing, serum production or other research.", " \"Our material consists of a combination of biological natural polymers and synthetic ones which has the ability, depending on its composition, to control its solubility in water which will then be decisive for the speed with which the material is dissolved in the body.”", "“It is still very far from going to patients –because as you know the process from laboratory to patient takes about 10 years under good conditions. First you have so called in vitro tests, where you use just cells cultivated outside the body, then you have to go through animal testing to prove the efficacy of the process and after you have all the data showing there are no side effects on the health of the animals tested you can ask for human clinical testing.”", "“Yes, we are at the stage of testing the hydrogel on animals.

Once we have the results of tests on miniature pigs we will be able to request approval for testing on human beings.”", "“Well, the first area is wound coverage. There are a large number of different wounds, either from surgical procedures, diabetic ulcers, wounds from traumas and all of them require a moist environment for healing and access of oxygen to the cells which are working to repair the tissue. Hydrogels have the ability to do that, they cover the wound, we can add additives which are bactericides, so they will prevent infection while helping the bioactive substances to accelerate healing and probably also reduce the amount of scarring. We have also had results over the last ten years – when we used these hydrogels with strengthening additives – to help healing in cases of large defects in bones. These tests were also conducted on miniature pigs and now there is a group at the faculty hospital in Brno which is applying for tests on humans.”", "“That’s correct. The hydrogel itself can be considered as a base material to which additives can be added for a specific application. That’s one possibility. It can also serve as a carrier for cells which are taken from the patient and cultivated on this material outside the body and then implanted. Because one problem that often occurs in this procedure is that the body does not accept synthetic materials or cells taken from animals.”", "“I would be very cautious in this respect. We do not want to give the impression that the material is good for everything. It is a fundamental material which we can work with and the European patent which we just received is on an additive that is based on a specific polymer which is able to form nano-containers and these containers can be used as vehicles to deliver drugs. There is a world-wide effort in doing so-called targeted drug delivery – for which you need specific surface groups which will attach to specific cells – but that is very far from being applicable on humans. So I would be very careful in this respect. I do not want to create the impression that we are already there.”", "“We developed the material directly for this particular use. What me have learnt – my colleague prof. Vojtová and others in the team –is that by additives we can expand on the possibilities afforded, such as that the material can be stabilized by UV light for example which will give it a specific field of application. In general, hydrogels are used in a broad range of products –from hygienic products to disinfection materials – so principally we can add multiple additives which can have multiple effects from a bactericidal effect to accelerating cell proliferation or changing colour, if you wish.”", "“Yes, we have broad collaboration with universities in the US, UK, Germany and Austria. International collaboration is something we firmly believe in at CEITEC.”", "“It would be a great satisfaction for us to see it helping people.

Most of the environmental institutes focussed on the outdoor environment, predominantly the quality of air, but nowadays it has been recognized that we have to look at other types of chemical exposure which is indoors and that includes cosmetics. There was a study performed in the Scandinavian countries focussing on lifestyle and the use of cosmetics, conducted on a group of pregnant women and their children, which tried to assess the major source of endocrine disruptors for the women and children and they found that it was actually the cosmetics, not the air or something else that was the major cause. So we figure that cosmetics and consumer products are a very important source. We already did some research on consumer products and the chemicals found in building materials, carpeting, furniture, computers and these kind of things. Because as I said, you spend 90 percent of your time in your home and when you think about chemical exposure on the human population there are basically three exposure pathways: one is through respiration, so you have to look at the quality of outdoor air and indoor air, but also the dust that we breathe, the second is dietary, meaning what we eat and it is important to look into the contents of food and especially fatty food that can contain a lot of chemicals (for small children dietary exposure can include household dust because they spend a lot of time on the floor putting things into their mouth) and the third exposure pathway is dermal, some of the cosmetics we use penetrate into the body.”", "\n    ", "\n    ", "\n    ", "“The question is what you can call a clean environment.

So during the winter the quality of the air in small villages can be much worse than in the big cities that rely more on central heating. As regards indoor environment, we did a study in Brno and the vicinity where we focussed on different kinds of buildings, because we suspected that the building materials would have a big impact on the quality of the environment and we found there was a huge difference in buildings built in the 1920s, 1950s and 1990s. It was a big study on family and apartment houses built in the last century, taking into account whether they had been reconstructed and remodelled later with new building materials and isolation materials and we could see pretty big differences. And we also noticed that indoor contamination is much more dependent on what kind of consumer products you bring into the house.

And this awareness is also something we rely on. In our population studies we completely rely on people’s goodwill, on their willingness to come and collaborate with us, to provide us with samples, to fill the questionnaires. There are a lot of studies based on patients, clinical studies in the hospitals but then we are only studying people who are already sick and we can only guess why they got sick, why they developed that particular disease.

But few could boast a career that over the last decade has been littered with the names of so many of the large multinational US companies in the forefront of technology and its applications as Zlín native David Pavlík. His career has jumped from Microsoft, to Amazon, multinational pay for film company Netflix, and currently the private company at the cutting edge of the new space race, SpaceX. ", " The role was a familiar one, but all the same Pavlík found that something was missing and that was the use of his basic technical skills which he believes are fundamental to any career.", "\n    ", "\n    ", "\n    ", " Amazon, which he joined in 2011, was well on the way to becoming one of the world leaders in e-commerce. Pavlík stayed there around a year. Netflix, the pay for film channel famed for its political thriller series, House of Cards, was still finding its feet. The Czech arrived as it began to confirm its early promise and actor Kevin Spacey was soon to make its name as the cynical political manipulator. Pavlík had a different role, part of the technical team making sure that the Netflix film offer and pages, with around 3,000 changes a day, was running smoothly.", " In fact, Pavlík also had a special mission to test the whole Netflix software infrastructure to see if he could bring that particular house of cards down. He was successful once or twice and the lessons learnt helped make the system became even more robust.", " Normally, Pavlík would not have been looking for a change but the opportunity to join a company at the technology cutting edge, the space rocket firm created by Elon Musk, SpaceX, was not to be missed. The first set of interviews did not land a job but he later got a call back telling him that a more suitable post had opened up. Seduced by the prospect of being part of mission to change human history and development, Pavlík did not hesitate.", " Musk had come to a rapidly evolving space sector with the role of the US space agency NASA narrowing to become a buyer of space services and technology offers and its place taken by private companies rapidly expanding. And Musk, who was also at the same time seeking to revolutionise the electric car market, had come to space with ideas which were more than sky high. He wanted to set the foundations for man to really conquer space and eventually colonise other planets not just be a temporary presence. Part of the path would mean cutting the costs of space travel and that would involve changing the economies of the most buoyant part of that market, the business of launching rockets into space to carry communications and other satellites.", "\n    ", "\n    ", "\n    ", " That market had been dominated by the European company Ariane and Russian, and more latterly Chinese, state agencies. But the concept was founded on one time use rockets which escalated costs. To Musk, this made about as much sense as aircraft manufacturers Boeing or Airbus having a plane that was used just for one journey and then replaced by another aircraft for the next scheduled flight. SpaceX’s revolutionary goal to pave the way for reusable rockets was born. In March this year that goal was achieved when the first stage of SpaceX’s Falcon rocket returned to the Kennedy Space Center ready to be used again. Pavlík is part of the follow up step which aims at converting the Dragon rockets, previously used for carrying cargo, including cargo to the International Space Station, to be able to take crew as well.", " The Czech was also at the brunt of the rocket programme involved with the high pressure and tense launches.", " While SpaceX has now established its launch credibility, that was not always the case in the early days with the whole rocket programme reportedly just one launch failure away from causing the whole project to fold.

Among his biggest achievements was the drug Tenofovir used to treat HIV sufferers that has helped millions of people the world over. In developing the drug Holý worked closely with the Belgian virologist Erik De Clercq. Prof. De Clercq gave Czech Radio’s correspondent in Brussels Filip Nerad an interview recalling his collaboration and personal friendship with Antonín Holý. ", "“Actually I came up with that name and I got the idea when we were once in Olomouc and I saw the monument there of the Holy Trinity. When Tony Holý told me it was called the Holy Trinity I got the idea of calling us the Holy trinity – with the accent on the y as in Holý. Holy was a real chemist, an organic chemist, I myself am a doctor of medicine, but I am very dedicated to chemistry. I never got a degree in chemistry but I love chemistry and that was of very big importance in my career. And the third person, John Martin who is CEO of Gilead Sciences is also a chemist. So the Holy Trinity is made up of two chemists and what I would call a ritual chemist –and that’s me.“", "“In the beginning this was indeed a kind of handicap, but it did not present a real difficulty. We had no problems exchanging compounds and there was no problem me getting the results of the tests to him, even though he was behind the Iron Curtain. I do not know if the situation was different for Holý but for me it did not present a problem. At the border when I came over I was never questioned, nor was I harassed when leaving the country. The situation was quite different with East Germany. I also collaborated with East Germans but there there was a ban on sending compounds. I never got any compounds from my friends in East Berlin. That was not possible.”", "“Yes, I think I cherish Tenofovir as my greatest discovery. But I would even go a little bit further. I would say that my greatest discovery was my discovery of the chemists –including doctor Holý –when I met them in Göttingen. I was the only non-chemist among them, I was a medical doctor –the only medical doctor present at this meeting. So the biggest discovery I ever made was the discovery of the chemists.“", "”Well, I have several compounds that I developed in cooperation with other chemists, which are of course overshadowed by those that I discovered with Holy. I think that I have something like ten drugs on the market, efficient drugs and at least three quarters of them are those that I have developed in cooperation with Holý.”", "“Well, I stared my career on Interferon that was around about 1967 – 1968 and Interferon was at the time considered a miraculous drug for the treatment of viral infections. AIDS did not exist at the time. So in the 1970s I described several compounds as inhibitors of the enzyme which is crucial in the replication of certain tumour viruses and which would later be shown to be also crucial in the replication of HIV, the causative agent of AIDS. But the term AIDS only popped up in 1981. The disease must have existed before but it was only recognized in 1981 and the origin of AIDS –HIV -was only ascertained in 1983. So when we started our collaboration the purpose was not to find a cure for AIDS but to find a solution to several viral infections. Later on, of course, we added the HIV to our arsenal of viruses for which we did biological evaluation.”", "“Well, it is difficult to assess this but we can certainly talk about millions of lives that were saved by our compounds. Certainly Tenofovir was a major discovery. It was not what we expected when we started our collaboration, but as we went further and further we realized that thanks to our efforts and this unique collaboration – what we can call East-West collaboration –we helped save the lives of millions of people.”", "“I would say it was based on a personal attraction. Holý trusted me and I trusted him. When I started this collaboration he was, let us say, the most important chemist in Eastern Europe. That is the reason why I was attracted to him. I am not going to say that I was the best in the field of biology but certainly he trusted me and he once wrote and said that he considered me to be the best chemist he had ever met among the medical doctors. So I think the reason behind our success was the fact that I am a chemist at heart, that I understood him and that I spoke his language. That is the reason why we were complementary – and the fact that he was behind the Iron Curtain, that did not matter.”"], "author": "Daniela Lazarová", "publish_date": "07/20/2017"},

They are more sensitive to stress, can suffer from emotional misbalance, are more prone to post-traumatic stress disorders and so on.

First of all we are studying the level of stress in the three generations and a control group. But we are also studying post-traumatic growth, using questionnaires. Post-traumatic growth means, that a certain person after exposure to stress, may present some growth, they become stronger.

But as regards young and old -our group of Holocaust survivors- they were all very young –or young -at the time of exposure. Also the experience they had during the war was very different. Some of them were in Auschwitz, others were in Terezin, many of the survivors were hidden or else they fought, they were partisans in Slovakia. So we need to collect as much data as possible from as many people as possible to have a reasonable cohort of people in order to distinguish the types of reactions, depending on the type of experience.”", "“I don’t know, it is one of the questions that we would like to answer.

It has been shown already that there is a certain genetic transfer, it was reported on in a study by Yehuda. So there are certain genetic transfers of stress. We are looking at so-called telomeres. Telomeres are the endings of chromosomes and it is known that they get shorter with age, but also with stress. We want to see whether this occurs in the second and the third generation. What is also new in our study is that we are not only looking at post-traumatic stress but also post-traumatic growth and we want to see whether there is an epigenetic transfer of this type of reaction as well.”", "“We are talking about the first generation, I assume. This probably played a role, but it is hard to study it now, after so many years. But to survive the Holocaust, to survive Shoah; the probability was low. So personality traits might have contributed to survival in certain cases. An Israeli study comparing Holocaust survivors with people who lived in Israel and Palestine during the war and were not exposed to the Holocaust, showed that the people who survived the Holocaust lived longer than the other group.

But it could be used in recent conflicts or conflicts occurring right now, for instance in the former Yugoslavia or currently in Syria. If we really find the neurobiological markers related to a certain kind of response to stress, indicating whether a person is at risk from post-traumatic stress disorder, or if it is more probable that the reaction will be post-traumatic growth, we could diagnose persons at risk and treat them at an early stage, for instance by psychotherapy.

The architecture of our laser is relatively simple. You have a low energy pulse at the beginning which is generated in a so-called oscillator and this pulse is amplified in a series of laser amplifiers with larger and larger apertures. There is a so-called regenerative amplifier, a booster amplifier, and at the end two cryogenically cooled amplifiers. And at the end the output parameters are 100 Joules and 10 Hertz which makes exactly 1 Kilowatt. An interesting feature is the pulse duration. For those not familiar with pulse duration is laser physics, as you know, the second is the measure of time but for these sophisticated machines can generate fractions of seconds so we are speaking about nanoseconds, and one nanosecond is one billionth of a second, so this means extremely short pulses.

So just to give some numbers, the previous record was 60 Joules and that was achieved at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the Bay Area of San Francisco. I was actually working there as a post doctoral [staff member] there, so I remember the excitement. And this value of 60 Joules remained for about 10 years.

Those communities were quite separate and they didn't even realize how apparently incompatible their points of view were until people started asking how would these different frameworks fit together. That question wasn't really appreciated until the 1970s or '80s of the previous century. So, it has really been a quest, an active quest, for the unification of those two paradigms over the past 30 or 40 years at best.\"", "\"Absolutely.\"", "\"Yes exactly. It is the first one you experience as a small child. The other three are somewhat mysterious before you encounter things like electromagnetism which is a fairly elementary force but it takes some power of abstract thinking to appreciate. But gravity is something we experience all the time from the first moments of childhood. Yet, in some ways it is the most mysterious of the forces. the other three can be unified within a fancy extension of quantum mechanics called quantum field theory, which deals with systems of many particles but gravity seems to be somewhat resistant to that. And outside of string theory there is no other elementary known mechanism for how to bring gravity into the equation. The other three interactions can be unified in a relatively straight forward way in a mathematically consistent framework which stays within the boundaries of quantum mechanics. As you said, it is gravity that is really the odd man out.\"", "\"Absolutely. And it also suggests some very natural ways of even unifying the other three interactions, although there you can also use more conventional means within quantum mechanics. String theory suggests very natural options but of course we don't know until they are proven in experiments, where we can reach high enough energies that we can probe whether any of these unified theories are actually realized in Nature. But there are several different options, several different mechanisms and string theory prefers some of them over others. In that sense it can even serve as a selection principle.\"", "\"Sure. The regime where the forces 'talked to each other much more' came to the forefront in the early universe and we certainly know, based in observational data in cosmology, that there was in the universe in that time period that the energy was high enough to probe this mysterious regime of unification of all forces.

What happens in string theory, and I think there is an important lesson in this, is that it does not modify the laws of quantum mechanics one bit.

The lesson there is maybe that the laws of quantum mechanics are very, very difficult, if not impossible, to modify.", "\"On the other hand, string theory very naturally modifies and improves and enhances the laws of general relativity and gravity. It modifies Einstein's theory in a way some people suspected would have to happen. Even though general relativity as a theory of gravity is probably considered the most beautiful physics theory that we have ever proposed as a civilization, it also suggests its natural demise and its natural limitations because it has a certain energy scale built in. Once the curvatures of space-time and the energies become large enough compared to this natural, fundamental scale of gravity theory asks for its own modification.

Money feels like money… except when it doesn’t. Money of the future will no longer be bills and will not be the digital money of today, either. Scientists at Palacký University in Olomouc have demonstrated that in all likelihood it will be quantum, ultra-secure and impossible to clone.", "“When the quantum money protocol was proposed for the first time the situation was very different from what we know today. One example: when it comes to experiments in the lab, we weren’t able to implement even the basics of quantum gates at that time. We have very much moved forward since then. Also, today we are capable of distributing quantum information at much longer distances, of dozens of kilometres, for instance, so we are slowly getting there. That is the reason why this concept was re-visited. In short, it is getting more important now.”", "“That’s exactly right. The advances in quantum information processing wouldn’t in way jeopardize classical paper money of course but will jeopardise the digital currency Bitcoin. Bitcoin is based on classical cipher algorithms and with quantum computers you will be able to break those algorithms much faster. Quantum computing can be a threat not only to classical digital currency but also to classical secure communications, such as the RSA cipher, for instance. With the advances in quantum computing we will need a more secure concept and that is what quantum physics can provide when it comes to be money as well as cryptography.”", "\n    ", "\n    ", "\n    ", "“Well of course in the quantum world there are different rules than in the classical world and what we experience on a daily basis. In the classical world, any state can be perfectly duplicated, at least in principle. In principle, you can take a sheet of paper and make a perfect duplicate in your copy machine. But in the quantum world, things are completely different. There is a fundamental law that prohibits making copies of an unknown quantum state: if I give you a photon or whatever system in an unknown, to you, quantum state, you won’t be able to perform a perfect replica. That is the cornerstone of security behind quantum money and quantum cryptography.”", "\n    ", "\n    ", "\n    ", "“It is. In the real world, you have to take into account imperfections. With paper money, you can have a corner torn off or a bill slightly torn but the central bank still recognizes the money as authentic and will accept it. In the theoretical concept, you can predict that the distribution of photons encoding the quantum bill would be perfect but in the real world you have imperfections. With quantum money, the bank will have to accept a slightly damaged banknote. Some photons can be missing or part of the sequence can be different. That’s just how it is and the bank would have to accept the bill. So what is crucial is that there has to be an acceptable threshold to close the opening gained for a potential counterfeiter.", "“If the threshold is too low, that enables potential counterfeiters to create a passable note, not a perfect copy – that is forbidden – but an approximate duplicate within quantum mechanical laws and sell it as a genuine. To set the threshold so that counterfeiting is impossible but slightly damages notes still be accepted - that’s the real trick. Luckily, it is possible and that is something we established in our paper, laying out possible encoding schemes.”", "“Hi-tech, maybe, but certainly it is achievable even with the current level of technology.

Most importantly Sunday of the two-day event was open to the public, for anyone interested in seeing some of the robots for themselves.", "“It was founded at the faculty at Charles University; the first year that we organized the event it was a very small meeting where we had to select three of four robots to be sent to an international robotic competition. But we made it public and the students asked the next year if we could do it again so we founded the event and it grew from 14 entries then to more than 140 this year.”", "“Not only university students, even gradually younger students from high schools have been t6aking part; I believe it is about two-thirds who are from university or secondary schools and one-third are fans or hobbyists. The aim is to motivate people to get into robotics, so many of the competitions are fairly easy but some are harder and that is where we get teams of older students.”", "“In one part of the competition there is such criteria: we run eight competitions, all of them in two formats or categories: one is that you can build a robot from just about anything you can find and the other is that you have to use a construction kit for robots, which can be Lego, Merkur, Meccano, ow whatever else so that they don’t have to deal with the mechanics. That is common for this part: they can programme their robot any way they like but they can’t use any other mechanical stuff of building tools.

If they meet an obstacle, or find what they find need to find, then they switch to the next goal.”", "“Yes, certainly it is really quite hard to make a robot that would be good at almost everything – for a parallel Nature had millions of years to evolve the human race but robots are here for around 100 years. So there is no comparison. But for technical tasks, you can have a robot which specializes in multiple tasks but more common you have robots which are specifically designed to fulfil a small number of tasks. And this set of tasks may be similar: you can have an autonomous robot car which run on any street but cannot run in the woods. Similarly, you can have a robot in a factory built to mill something or join parts but you definitely can’t send it to get coffee. Likewise, you can have a robot which gets coffee, but it won’t then be putting a shift in at the car making plant!”", "\n    ", "\n    ", "\n    ", "“Bear Rescue is one of my favourites: we founded it to see if we could send a robot to fetch stuff for us.

In the simple version, the robot is radio-controlled but in the advanced it is autonomous and has to find teddy in a simple maze-like environment.", "“In Ketchup House, there is a parallel in real life: imagine a storehouse where you have stuff and you send robots to get it. There are grids of black lines on the floor representing the storage room and the starting point and two separate robots are sent to get cans of ketchup. At the same time, the robots in the storage area can steal cans from each other.

The conditions can be different, the floor has a different color or something like that, and they have to fix everything just before the competition. Sometimes they succeed and sometimes they don’t.", "“Even if they pass the homologation where we check whether the robot is safe and doing what it should, in the competitions something can break. The robots can collide, parts may fall off, if it is from Lego for example, robots can hit the wall.

It is the opposite: we want the participants to do something and we provide them the opportunity for them to compare and to learn from others. Most of the problems they face have already been solved by someone else. If the teams meet at one place they can help each other; in fact these matches are only a tiny part of the event’s purpose, the tip of the iceberg above the water.

I asked the psychologist why he believed the 1971 study was still so well-known today.", "“There’s almost no place I go where people don’t know it. A taxi driver in Budapest said, Oh, you did that prison study? Students say, I studied your study in high school and I became a psychologist because of you.", "“I think there are two reasons why the study has lasting impact. First of all, the design of the study itself was dramatic.", "“Most research in psychology is usually one hour. And you prove one thing.", "“In my experiment, by design, people lived in this setting 24 hours a day, day after day. The people playing the role of guards worked eight hours a day, and we videotaped everything that was happening", "“What it means is you can observe the gradual transformation of human character. This is what drama is all about. This is what movies are about.", "“So it’s the only psychological study where you can see the change of people from day one to day two and so forth.", "“The second reason is, it’s such a powerful demonstration of how situations change individual behaviour.", "\n    ", "\n    ", "\n    ", "“We all like to think that our decisions come from within. Now we see that sometimes we have an assigned role: you’re a prisoner, you’re a guard, you become a mother, you’re a father, you’re a teacher.", "“And suddenly you become the role and the role becomes you.", "“It demonstrates that really good people could do bad things very quickly – and that it could be me.”", "“No, I disagree with that. I think most people are good most of the time, or that most of us have a blend of positive and negative personality traits that come out depending on the situation.”", "“Oh, for sure. That’s another message of the study: Human nature is malleable.", "“It can be modified, sometimes transformed completely, by the experiences we face, by things around us.", "“But in fact all of these things are more likely to be a reflection of your friends, your family, your culture and of the time.”", "“In 2004 America was humiliated and the world was amazed at the revelation of images – there were about a dozen images – of American in a prison in Iraq called Abu Ghraib degrading, humiliating and sexually assaulting prisoners who they should have been protecting.", "“Instead they put themselves in the pictures, doing horrible things…”", "“To be honest, those 12 pictures are not the worst. There are more than 1,000 that I was asked to review to be an expert witness.", "“Now what happened was, when those pictures were released, the media came to me and said, Zimbardo, those are exactly like your study: In both cases guards put bags over the prisoners’ heads, in both cases they stripped them naked, in both cases they did sexually humiliating things to them.", "“So I got interested in, what is the similarity between my experiment and this real world event?", "\n    ", "\n    ", "\n    ", "“I became an expert witness for one of the guards, really so I could understand the situation better.", "“But from the beginning I said, He’s guilty. What he did was wrong, no question about it. He’s in the pictures doing bad things.", "“But my goal was to find out how likely it was that he would never have done those things if the military hadn’t put him in an impossible situation.", "“The judge wanted to give him 15 years in jail. He didn’t kill anybody – he just humiliated them.", "“But the American military wanted to have a show, to say, We’ve punished him.", "“And I was able to say, Your honour, Chip Frederick is guilty as charged. However, after spending much time interviewing him, his family, looking at his background and understanding all the dynamics of that situation, I can say he never would have done any of those things if the military had not put him in an impossible situation.", "“I said, If Chip Frederick is a bad apple, somebody put him in a bad barrel and that somebody is the bad barrel makers: the Bush administration and the military.", "“So I was able to get his sentenced reduced from 15 years ultimately to only four. He still served hard time for four years.”", "“You have to understand what people, who are different, bring to situations.", "“Secondly, what does a particular situation bring out of all the people there.", "“Third, what is the system that maintains, justifies and could alter those situations.", "“And the idea was, in all prisons there must be very clear rules of what is acceptable and unacceptable behaviour by the guards.", "“Secondly, there has to be oversight: You can have a rule on the wall, but do they follow it?", "“So you need higher order administration seeing if the rules are being followed.", "“At Abu Ghraib in three months no senior officer ever went down to the dungeon. That means they told the guards, Do whatever you have to do so we get confessions.", "“But there was no limit. So once the guards started stripping the prisoners naked, putting them in a pyramid, doing all these terrible things, there was nobody to say, Limit! Nobody said, You can’t go there.”", "\n    ", "\n    ", "\n    ", "“Young men around the world are growing up in a world of virtual reality and they are giving up what we call social reality.", "“They are sacrificing friends for game-playing.

You’re not reading, you’re not writing, you’re not exercising, you’re not talking to friends – sometimes you’re not having meals with family.", "“To make matters worse, in recent years, for the first time in history, there is freely available pornography 24 hours a day, seven days a week, by pressing a button.", "“If you’re a young male, here are stunningly beautiful, sexy naked women who in many of the videos want to have sex with you.

{"header": "GoodAI’s Marek Rosa Part 1 - Solving general AI would change everything", "body": ["Prague-based video game designer Marek Rosa, founder of Keen Software House, recently established a firm focussing on artificial intelligence. Last July, Rosa launched GoodAI, contributing 10 million dollars of his own money to fund research into the development of general artificial intelligence and unveiled a roadmap outlining how the company hopes to achieve its goals within as little as 10 years. Can general AI be achieved? By which methods? Those are some of the questions we discussed.", "“The long-term goal is to create Artificial Intelligence with a human level skill set. To get there, we will need to design an AI architecture which will enable the AI to learn, to acquire skills gradually, basically, acquiring one skill - solving a set problem - and then another and another and so on. One skill on the list could be the ability to learn much more efficiently. Leaning to learn more efficiently is an important aspect in itself. If you have this kind of a system, then there are practically no limits in what the system could learn to solve. People, if they have enough time, can solve anything.”", "“Yes, of course. At the same time, the hardcoded parts of the algorithm should be minimal. We have two classes of skills or abilities: the first are called intrinsic skills or atomic properties: these are the skills that the system needs to have from Day 1, from the moment it is launched. And, then there is another class of skills, which are learned. We plan for the AI to learn these at what call School for AI. This is where the AI will learn many tasks. It is similar to the way education works with people. When you are born you have some DNA, you have some neurons and they have to function in a certain way and if there is some error or if something goes wrong, you will not learn. Then, there is the external part: the environment, the teachers, society where you learn useful skills. So, it is very similar, in a way.”", "“Still, there are many different ways to try and achieve this. At the core, you are sending some data to the AI and the AI tries to come up with some models, some hypotheses, that will explain the data or react to it in a way that you want. The AI needs to be able to evaluate multiple possible solutions and you repeat this process until the AI begins to solve or present possible solutions to the problem. Today many of the problems which can be solved are very narrow. In the case of face-recognition, you will show it pictures in the form of pixels and also you include some signal or value such as ‘the object you are looking for is there or it isn’t’. Or maybe some other additional information. The AI then tries to form a model which answers the problem.”", "“I have been interested in AI since forever. I know that if we ever successfully achieve artificial intelligence that we will be able use it to solve a great many problems which are currently beyond our reach. I also view this as certain leverage: instead of humans trying to work on certain tasks, we could create AI that would then scale itself and clone itself and tackle some of these problems. Since it should be able to learn, the idea that it would solve things much more efficiently than if you or I were trying to do it. So, I see it as a way of being more efficient.”", "“I actually think we could be quite similar, at least at first. In the beginning, the General AI or Strong AI could be quite similar, although of course there will also be differences. As it learns more and grows the differences would become more marked. But even we of course have the ability, within certain limits, to improve ourselves, to add to our own skill sets. Every day, each of us learns something new and we use these skills to learn new things. If we learn to read and write it takes us far beyond just oral communication and it is far more efficient. The drive to learn is something that needs to be in the default of the AI which we are designing. This AI will always try to improve itself. It should be able to uncover solutions too complex or time-consuming for us.”", "“Well the short-term goal would be that but the long-term goal would be something which goes beyond our own skills. It can be beneficial to start by emulating what we know how to do in a way that the AI will later continue self-exploration and so on. It will be biased by what it has learned from us but will also discover new skills. The key is for the skills it adopts or adapts to, to be safe for us. We do not want to ever be in a situation when the AI would invent something which would be dangerous for us. The AI should understand the world in a similar way to us. If it has a similar sense of the world, it should increase the chances the AI will behave the way you want it to.”"], "author": "Jan Velinger", "publish_date": "11/26/2016"},

A bad decision is exactly what we don’t want to happen. If you have input, by video sensors, on a self-driving car, it has to recognize that children playing on the road are children and react accordingly. The same is true of other AI: to assess the situation and make the proper decision.

So the AI needs to understand the world but it doesn’t have to be to motivate by human-like emotions.”", "“Yes, there is of course a risk, if it were not properly educated.

Black holes, despite the name, emanate plenty of energy and light and are among the brightest objects in the universe. The reason is because as and matter sucked into a black hole heats up and radiates as it accretes: in Interstellar, the fictional Gargantua features a massive accretion disc which provides heat and light for nearby planets, including the one called Miller’s – not quite habitable but agonizingly close.", "But what about a much older black hole, with no accretion disc to speak of, the kind considered by the Czech team?

Such a scenario posits a ‘bizarro’ version of conditions here on Earth. Life as we know it benefits from the difference in temperature between the sun and a cool sky; in the Czech scientists’ scenario, the conditions would be reversed: a hot sky and cool object orbited.", "Gauging what that alien sky would look like near a black hole sounds like a gargantuan task in itself.", "\n    ", "\n    ", "\n    ", "Miller’s planet, landed on by the crew in Interstellar, is in many ways a different and also fictional beast.
